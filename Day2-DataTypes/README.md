# JavaScript Data Types

Data types are the foundation of every programming language. In JavaScript, data types describe the kind of value a variable can hold. They determine how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in your program.

## Categories of Data Types

JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

### 1. Primitive Data Types

These are the most basic kinds of data. They include:

* **String** → text data like `"Hello"`
* **Number** → integers and decimals like `42` or `3.14`
* **Boolean** → true/false values
* **Undefined** → declared but not given a value
* **Null** → intentional absence of value
* **Symbol** → unique identifiers
* **BigInt** → numbers too large for regular integers

### 2. Non-Primitive Data Types

These are more complex structures:

* **Objects** → collections of key–value pairs
* **Arrays** → ordered lists of values
* **Functions** → reusable blocks of code

## Why Learn Data Types?

* Helps you **store values correctly**
* Prevents **unexpected bugs**
* Makes your code **clearer and maintainable**
