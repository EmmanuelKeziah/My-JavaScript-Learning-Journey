This folder contains the lesson code, exercises, and solutions for **Day 1**.

Today, weâ€™re diving into the concept of **variables** in JavaScript. Think of a variable as a little container where you keep something safe until you need it.  

### A Fun Example: Blood in the Lab
Imagine youâ€™re in a biology lab. You take a sample of blood and put it inside a labeled bottle. That bottle isnâ€™t the blood itself, it is just holding the blood for later use.  

## ðŸ“– Lesson Summary
- Variables are like containers or labels.  
- `let` is flexible, `const` is fixed, `var` is old school.  
- Think of them as bottles in a lab, your shopping cart, or your school bag.
