# Day 1: Variables (tiny pockets of data that changed the world)
This folder contains the lesson code, exercises, and solutions for **Day 1**.  
**Date Published:** September 23rd, 2025  

Today, weâ€™re diving into the concept of **variables** in JavaScript. Think of a variable as a little container where you keep something safe until you need it.  

### A Fun Example: Blood in the Lab
Imagine youâ€™re in a biology lab. You take a sample of blood and put it inside a labeled bottle. That bottle isnâ€™t the blood itself, it is just holding the blood for later use.  ---

##ðŸ“„ Examples

// Example 1: Blood sample in a lab
let bloodSample = "O+";
console.log("Blood Sample:", bloodSample);

// Example 2: Shopping cart at the mall
let shoppingCart = "Apples";
console.log("Shopping Cart:", shoppingCart);

// Update value inside the cart
shoppingCart = "Bananas";
console.log("Updated Shopping Cart:", shoppingCart);

// General variable use
let sample = "Blood A";
console.log("Sample:", sample);

sample = "Blood B";
console.log("Updated Sample:", sample);


## ðŸ“– Lesson Summary
- Variables are like containers or labels.  
- `let` is flexible, `const` is fixed, `var` is old school.  
- Think of them as bottles in a lab, your shopping cart, or your school bag.
